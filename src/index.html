            <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
            <p>
                Currently a Computer Science student at UNICAP. 
                I have a passion for continuously learning and 
                navigating the fascinating world of technology. 
                As a Competitive Programmer, I delve into algorithms 
                that help solve diverse problems, which is a source 
                of endless intrigue for me.

            <h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
            <img src="./Images/competitive-programming.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Competitive Programming is a mind sport where 
                programmers compete to <b>solve problems</b> using a 
                programming languages such as <b>C++</b>.<br>
                It is a great way to improve your <b>problem-solving
                skills</b> and learn new <b>algorithms and data structures</b>.
            <br><br>
                In the past two years I have participated in several 
                competitions made by the <b>Brazilian Computer Society</b> 
                and the <b>International Collegiate Programming Contest</b>.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Lounge do Açaí</h3>
            <img src="./Images/lounge-logo.png" alt="">
            <p>
                This project consists of a <b>self-service system</b> 
                developed to enhance the efficiency and user 
                experience at the <b>Lounge do Açaí</b>, located at 
                Universidade Católica de Pernambuco.
            <br><br>
                The system allows users to place orders through a 
                <b>mobile application</b>, which are then sent to the 
                kitchen via a <b>bluetooth printer</b>. This 
                integration optimizes the ordering process and 
                improves communication between customers and staff.

            <img src="./Images/password-game.png" alt="">
            <p>
                This project is a simple game where the user has to 
                guess a password. The password is a string of 4 
                characters, which can be letters or numbers. The user 
                has as many attempts to guess the password as they want.
            <br><br>
                The game is developed using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and 
                <b>JavaScript</b>. It is a great way to practice your 
                programming skills and have fun at the same time.
            <br><br>
                You can play the game by clicking the button below.
